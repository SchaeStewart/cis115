<h1>Software Development process</h1>
<h2>Program 1: Area of a Circle</h2>
<p>1. Request: We received our instructions from you and began looking over the first assignment. Since the program was fairly simple we briefly discussed how to get the user's input and then we moved to step 4: Implementation. After writing the program, we did Google to double check our formula for calculating the area of a circle. We then moved on to step 5: Testing. We ran the program and it had no errors. We tested both a positive and negative value to make sure the results were correct and then we were done.</p>
<h2>Program 2: Temperature Check</h2>
<p>
For step 1 we received our instructions from you again and started discussing the problem. Step 2 involved us discussing what we thought the proper temperatures should be, which led us to write down those values for step 3. In step 4 we wrote the program. For step 5 we ran the program multiple times using values to satisfy both conditions
</p>
<h2>Program 3: Primary Colors</h2>
<p>
Once again we received our instructions from you and began discussing the assignment. For step 2 we talked about what outputs we would have, and we researched the str.lower() method so that we could ignore the case of the string. In step 3 we handwrote some pseudocode for our if statements and then we began working on step 4. We started writing the program and after we wrote the first if statement, we tested it to make sure our 'and'/'or' logic was working. After seeing that it was working we finished writing the program and started testing each of the conditions. We the realized that we had a logic error with our 'and'/'or' and that we needed to switch them. After we worked through the logic issues, we tested the program again with conditions to meet each of the values. After we had done all that, Alan asked what it would take to put the program into a loop, so we researched while loops in python and then implemented and tested it.

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
For the first and second programs the full software development process was not necessary; however for the third program it was useful. We seemed to use step 2 and 3 the least, especially step 3. The are useful steps but for simple programs they are the return on invested time is not worth it.
